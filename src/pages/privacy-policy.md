This website does not collect any personal data. It does not set any cookies and it does not use any third-party tracking scripts. No user analytics or other metrics are processed during your visit, and the server does not write any log files, which means your IP address is not stored anywhere.

## Secure Data Transfer

This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider may still be able to see that you are loading files from this site, but not their content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data e.g. while browsing on public WiFi, or network providers injecting ads into this site.
