_The grass isn't greener on the other side. The following is an essay on Linux and Windows, and why I chose Windows after being a huge Linux user for over 3 years._ 

I am an experienced Linux user and a fan of open-source software. I've used everything from Debian, Arch, Fedora, and their mainstream derivative distros. Mostly I had maintained a dual-boot system, but at times, daily drove Linux as my main and only OS. I am enthusiastic about security and privacy and passionate about Linux. I occasionally read news of the latest developments in Wayland, Gnome, KDE, and the Linux Kernel. With all that said, I've been a Windows user for as long as I remember using computers, and will continue to be one primarily. Here is why.

## The Windows Experience isn't bad
I have never felt that Windows was a buggy and messy OS. Sure, there are plenty of examples of that online, but I have not experienced such. Windows is annoying at times, but not **that** buggy. Over time, I've mastered how to maintain a Windows installation perfectly, and have always had a wonderful experience with the OS.

I've learned security etiquette to identify malicious software, PUPs, adware, and can steer clear of them while keeping my installation clean and secure without the need for a third-party antivirus running active scans all the time. System apps don't crash on me. Big picture, you can fully utilise Microsoft's vast array of well-made first-party apps and an even bigger platform of power-user apps. I admit that I use many tools to Windows in check, to not be annoying, but with my setup on Windows, I do *enjoy* using my PC.

Linux is a tool. I use it to augment and automate certain tasks. I enjoy using and fiddling with Linux, but I would want to use my PC instead of tinkering with it my spare time and move on with my personal life.

## Installation and Setup
Objectively, I do not find Windows inferior in the process of installation and setup of software. Let's dissect my statement.

First let's go over drivers. The *point* of using Windows is preferring the proprietary software and drivers that are available over open source drivers on Linux. Most things are automatically downloaded from Windows Update, but you can get your component drivers from your device vendor, or individually from Intel, Nvidia, etc, and check for updates occasionally. It works. Now, on Linux, most people don't have to think about drivers *at all*. That is absolutely amazing. There is not much comparison on this point between the two unless you have some specific requirement. My point being __both of them work__.

When it comes to apps, essentially, both systems are equal. On Linux, the cherished terminal is touted as a fast and straightforward way to install apps. I am a hardcore terminal user and don't shy away from it at all. However, on Windows, installing apps is better than people like to believe, and how it is perceived online. The Windows Store, Winget Package Manager and it's slew of GUI wrappers, and simply searching for apps on Google or Bing gives you access to an equal or greater set of apps to install, and they work *reliably*.Use Adblock when navigating the web to avoid scam websites and web elements, and verify downloads if seem suspicious. Use common sense and it's a highly functional system. On Linux, although it is nice to open your terminal and install popular apps in one command, it is not always that simple, with version, availability, and permission issues.

The problem with Linux is needless redundancy. There are a lot of disparities in package managers and packaging formats, and one can easily run into version and availability issues. Having to package apps for an increasing list of distros is incredibly wasteful. The various app standards are repetitive and confusing for new users. In my experience, the correct way to navigate this web of standards to install apps is to use system-wide dependencies for most things and Flatpak for certain apps, but not everyone is clear about this, and at times, I *do* stumble across tar.gz, Snaps and AppImage as the only available formats for apps that may be non-negotiable for me. 

You can just not care about these issues and install whatever you want, that leads to another issue, "dependency hell". So, it is not a perfect solution. What matters is _getting used to either workflow._

## The App Inequality
The inequality of apps present on either platform is narrowing, but there. I think Open-Source alternatives to all software is not the answer, and that **pure** libre distros and software is not completely a good idea for competitiveness. To be clear, I am not blaming anyone on the Linux side or making this their problem. It’s not, but still, there is a clear reason to prefer Windows — using the best tools for the job — Microsoft Office, Adobe Suite, countless other professional apps, and thousands of games. For those involved in _privateering_, all those guides, cracks, and activators exist for Windows. Giving it up and looking to alternative open-source programs doesn’t cut it for everyone. If I am going to be incredibly honest, this might the biggest reason for me to stay on the Windows platform.

## Performance
I'd like to also dive into GPU based workflows, like games. Gaming on Linux is better than ever. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlg4K16ujFw">Linus Tech Tips</a> made a whole series on reviewing Linux, and they are more serious gamers than myself. The conclusion of the series matched my general opinion that while you can certainly game on Linux, there are many things you are missing out on - trying out the latest games as they come out, and most big multiplayer games due to anti-cheat are unplayable. The importance of the gaming culture of trying out random games, and effortlessly hopping onto a match with your friends is only felt when you can't do it. While AMD supports it's upscaling FidelityFX, and basically all of it's features on Linux, Nvidia users who want to use all the latest features their expensive cards support, should sit out on Linux for now. The data shows that there is not a noticeable performance difference between the OS's, and nor am I personally interested in getting some more FPS, but it's the stark inequality of effort by the company here.

## Appearance
The UI of Windows 11 is simply incredible. The 2022 updates have smashed it out of the park. Paired with a decent machine, it works well, and looks great. I am proud to also say that the Linux DE's have caught up. Gnome 4x and KDE 5.x are freaking amazing today. I am happy to say that they are comparable to Windows, so picking one is an individual preference.

## Knowledge and Culture
Using Windows, my tech knowledge, know-how, and troubleshooting skills are top-notch, for my own sake and for others. I don't mind being the Tech Support person in my circle. I like problem-solving, digging into the OS I'm using and openly welcome interesting tech hurdles others face.

My expertise in technology goes beyond my knowledge and journey; I am proud to play an active part in the Tech Cohort of our times. With that said, I would say that I am a very advanced user and easily fit into any talks about Linux in the general Tech Community. Knowing the depths of your OS is always a nice CS lesson, for Windows and Linux alike. There is no lack of culture in the Linux community, it’s vast, grand and pretty fun to read on. So, it’s a tie here.

## Virtualisation
Running Linux on Windows is much easier than the other way around. Microsoft has created an expansive ecosystem that runs Linux and Android software on Windows in a hassle-free way. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a mature project and is suitable for the development and testing of Linux. It provides the most seamless integration between the two operating systems. If I were to daily drive Linux, I would not be comfortable to use virtualized Windows for a handful of apps, at least with my current hardware. If I had a balling PC, things would could be different. It still wouldn't make sense with a laptop.

For some time, the problems, inconveniences, and disruptions regarding dual boot didn’t concern me much. Maybe, I just didn’t have much real then work. Anyway, what is expected from the Tech workflow of regular high schoolers? *Now, I need to use one OS.* Dual booting is just a pain.

## Miscellaneous
* I tried a lot of distros, and seemed to settle for the perfect – Fedora, but she broke my heart. The community accepted me with wide arms and a warm hug, but the distro didn’t. I have had issues, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/vg06mf/the_crazy_story_of_fedora_and_its_kernel">which I have outlined in detail in this Reddit post.</a>
* No widespread adoption of Secure Boot on Linux.
* Nvidia driver support on non-Ubuntu based distros including the signing of kernel modules, Nouveau, systemd-boot and tons of kernel panics.
* Ricing being a colossal waste of time.

It doesn’t affect my conscience using Windows. I thought about it, and I don't really care. It is good having opinionated software. Just my thoughts.

## The Thesis
In this essay, I have compared Windows and Linux as operating systems for power users on many grounds like performance, appearance and installation. I have shown why someone with an appreciation for Linux would use Windows as their main system and how users looking to get the most out of their OS might find Windows better.

I have discussed the advantage and disadvantages of both systems in terms of compatibility, usability, and market share. I have also explained how choosing one system over another depends on personal preference, workflow, and goals..

## My Opinion on Other Views
Reading other takes for this debate online, I often disagree with arguments blaming the Linux community or developers for its flaws. I think this approach is unfair and misleading.

As a member of the Linux community, I have a vested interest in seeing open-source projects grow and become better. However, I am not biased towards Linux to the point of condemning Microsoft or other companies that seek to undermine Linux users. Open-source software is developed without any monetary gain, and therefore, there is no need for anyone to push their understanding of Linux on others.

Users have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to use Linux or join the community, and no one should impose their preferences on them. While I encourage people to contribute to the Linux community, I don't want to hinder their improvements or sound egocentric. It's important to note that some people are working paid jobs to enhance security and Linux compatibility.

Still, it's unfair to blame them for any drawbacks of Linux distributions compared to their competitors. I think that it's acceptable to criticize Linux, but it should not be directed at the people behind it, given that Linux is entirely free.

I prefer to take a neutral position that appreciates the people working on these projects and their dedication to creating something amazing. In everything I do, I want to be respectful of everyone's passion pushing these projects.

## Why use Linux?
I’ve spent a ton of my time on Linux and have made a realization. I was thinking about why should one use Linux? What is the reason behind picking one distro over the other? Apart from the obvious reasons, it is the philosophy.

You prefer Linux over Windows because in every essence of it’s design, it assumes that the user knows what they are doing, and that in the default state of the OS, the user should have complete control over their system. You pick one distro over the other not because it has ‘Gnome’ and the has ‘XFCE’, Linux systems are the most versatile and modular, so you pick one over the other because you agree more with it’s philosophy regarding installation of apps, or how bleeding-edge it’s update cycle is, and so. That is the only thing that is truly different, and truly matters. Everything else is a matter of picking the most convenient ‘starting-point’ for how you want to configure a system to your liking.

It is understood that Linux is ‘there’ in terms of readiness for _personal use_. I have just realized that given my use case, I’d rather use Windows than be on the other side for this purpose. Linux is better on servers and IoT devices, and I’d happily use Linux there. Linux is also meant to be great for development, which is true mostly because it’s most convenient on Linux, but I have many great tools on Windows as well. I am curious about computer software and design and Linux is a fantastic bastion of learning, and I will always hang on to that.

## The Conclusion
So, because the underlying philosophy of Windows doesn’t bug me, and that I enjoy the benefits of staying on Windows, I use Windows 11 these days.
